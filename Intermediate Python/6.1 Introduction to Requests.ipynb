    "_requests_ is a third-party Python library created to allow Python to handle HTTP requests and it is one of the most popular non-standard library modules. The creator, Kenneth Reitz, also created [HTTP Bin](httpbin.org) which is a helpful tool for inspecting and debugging HTTP client behavior. The source code for requests can be found [here] (https://github.com/psf/requests) and is updated regularly. Its documention [here](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)."

Websites tailor their layouts and design in accordance to the type of machine, operating system and application making the request. A collection of information on the software and hardware of the source is sometimes called “user agent”. Otherwise, content might be displayed incorrectly.\n",
    "If the website in question does not recognize the user agent, it will often default to one of these two actions.
