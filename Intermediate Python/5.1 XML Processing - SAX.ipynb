    "SQL databases are useful for storing large amounts of data. However, sometimes we want to store data in a less complicated data structure. This is useful as a format for **data interchange**. For example, we have already seen how JSON can do this since it is independent of programming language and platform. XML (Extensible Markup Language) is another such data format. There are two librarys for working with XML in the PSL called **SAX** and **DOM**. Starting with the SAX module,"
